## Introduction

This repository contains the code for my master's thesis project, which focuses on intelligent job scheduling using Graph Neural Network-based Reinforcement Learning (GNN-RL). The project explores innovative techniques to optimize the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) by leveraging GNN-RL algorithms.

## About the Project

In the field of manufacturing and production, efficient job scheduling is crucial to optimize resources, reduce costs, and improve productivity. The Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is a classic optimization challenge, and this project seeks to address it using advanced machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques.

### Key Features

- **Graph Neural Network-based RL**: The core of this project is the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in combination with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to tackle the JSSP. GNNs enable the modeling of complex relationships between jobs and resources, while RL facilitates intelligent decision-making in scheduling.

- **Custom Environment**: A custom environment for simulating and modeling the JSSP problem is included. This environment serves as the testing ground for training and evaluating the GNN-RL-based scheduling algorithms.

<!--## Repository Contents

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the GNN-RL-based job scheduling algorithms and models.
- `environment/`: Includes the custom Python environment for modeling and simulating the JSSP.
